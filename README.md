# The Tiles Challenge 

This repo is hosted on Heroku at http://tiles-challenge-6178.herokuapp.com/

Note: If the click counts aren't updating correctly on Heroku, it's probably because I turned off the worker dynos.


## Specs

I've written feature specs for this project using RSpec, Capybara, and Selenium. Chrome-driver is needed to run the specs with Selenium. I used Homebrew to install chromedriver on my machine.

```brew install chromedriver```
